# Introduction

First, when you arrive on the website, you will be on the login page. I assume that if it’s the first time you go on the website, you won’t have an account. So what you should do first is create an account by clicking on sign up on the menu on the top. When you have informed all the information and clicked on the button to sign up, you will have a link popping in the middle of your screen, that’s because your account is not activated. What you will have to do is copy the link and paste it on the search bar and your account is activated, the link is available for 24 hours, after that it will expire and you won’t be able to activate your account.

If you already have an account, you should go on the login page, inform your email and password and click on the button login. If you forgot you password, you can click on forgotten password and like the activate account you will have a link in which you can reset your password.
